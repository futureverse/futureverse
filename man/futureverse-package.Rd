\title{futureverse: Easily Install and Load the 'Futureverse'}
\description{
The 'futureverse' is a set of packages for parallel and distributed process with the 'future' package at its core, cf. Bengtsson (2021) \doi{10.32614/RJ-2021-048}. This package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple 'futureverse' packages in a single step. Learn more about the 'futureverse' at \url{https://www.futureverse.org}. This package is intended for end-users, interactive use, and R scripts. Packages must not list it as a dependency - instead, explicitly declare each 'Futureverse' package as a dependency as needed.
